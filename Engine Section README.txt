One of the major "game mechanics" of Engine Section is the "Other" option you will see on several screens.

Clicking this option will bring up a text field. Certain options can be unlocked on certain screens by typing the correct keyword into this text field. All of these options can be accessed by typing a SINGLE word or number into the text field which is relevant to the enviroment.

However, the fact that a screen has this option does not mean that there are any hidden options on that screen.
